# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve mcpset! Until the first public release the project follows these lightweight rules:

1. **Discussions first** – open an issue describing the problem and desired outcome.
2. **Testing** – add/extend pytest coverage for any change in merge logic or file parsers.
3. **Format/Lint** – run `ruff check .` and `pytest` locally before submitting a PR.
4. **Sensitive data** – never include real MCP endpoints, tokens, or home-directory paths in commits or examples.

Once the roadmap stabilizes this doc should cover code style, release process, and triage policies in more detail.
